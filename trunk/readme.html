	<p style="text-align: center">Lightweight Personal Publishing Platform </p>
	<h2 id="installation">Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory.</li>
		<li>Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection
		  details.</li>
		<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> .</li>
		<li>Upload everything.</li>
		<li>Launch <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">/wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. This should setup the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <span class="file">wp-config.php</span> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather. </li>
		<li><strong>Note the password given to you.</strong></li>
		<li> The install script should then send you to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username <code>admin</code> and the password generated during the installation. You can then click on 'Profile' to change the password.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Upgrading</h2>
	<p>Before you upgrade anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as <code>index.php</code>.</p>
	<h2>Upgrading from any previous WordPress to SteamPress:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Delete your old WP files, saving ones you've modified .</li>
		<li>Upload the new files.</li>
		<li>Point your browser to <a href="wp-admin/upgrade.php">/wp-admin/upgrade.php</a>.</li>
		<li>You wanted more, perhaps? That's it!</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Template Changes</h2>
	<p>If you have customized your templates, you will probably have to make some changes
	  to them. If you're converting your WordPress 1.2 or earlier templates, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5"> we've created a special guide for you</a>.</p>
	<h2>Online Resources</h2>
	<p>If you have any questions that aren't addressed in this document, please take advantage of WordPress' numerous online resources:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">The WordPress Codex</a></dt>
		<dd>The Codex is the encyclopedia of all things WordPress. It is the most comprehensive source of information for WordPress available. </dd>
		<dt><a href="http://wordpress.org/development/">The Development Blog</a></dt>
		<dd>This is where you'll find the latest updates and news related to WordPress. Bookmark and check often. </dd>
		<dt><a href="http://planet.wordpress.org/">WordPress Planet</a></dt>
		<dd>The WordPress Planet is a news aggregator that brings together posts from WordPress blogs around the web. </dd>
		<dt><a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">WordPress Support Forums</a></dt>
		<dd>If you've looked everywhere and still can't find an answer, the support forums
		  are very active and have a large community ready to help. To help them help
		  you, be sure to use a descriptive thread title and describe your question
		  in as much detail as possible. </dd>

		  who use WordPress and occasionally support topics. The above wiki page should
		  point you in the right direction. (irc.freenode.net #wordpresss) </dd>
	</dl>

	<h2 id="requirements">System Recommendations</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>PHP version <strong>4.1</strong> or higher</li>
		<li>MySQL version <strong>3.23.23</strong> or higher</li>
		<li>... and a link to <a href="http://steamedpenguin.com/projects/steampress/">http://steamedpenguin.com/projects/steampress/</a> on your site.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>SteamPress is fork of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> 1.5.2. The aim is to remain WP 1.5.2 compatible while fixing bugs and removing
	  some unnecessary features.</p>

	<h2>Upgrading from another system</h2>
	<p>SteamPress can <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_from_other_blogging_software">import from a number of systems</a>. First, you need to get SteamPress installed and working as described above.</p>

	<h2 id="templates">XML-RPC Interface</h2>
	<p>You can now post to your SteamPress blog with tools like <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a>, <a href="http://blogbuddy.sourceforge.net">BlogBuddy</a>, <a href="http://bloggar.com/">Bloggar</a>, <a href="http://www.ubique.ch/wapblogger/">WapBlogger</a> (post from your Wap cellphone!), <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a> (which means you can use Radio's email-to-blog feature), <a href="http://www.zempt.com/">Zempt</a>, <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com/">NewzCrawler</a>, and other tools that support the Blogging APIs! :) You can read more about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support">XML-RPC support on the Codex</a>.</p>

	<h2>Post via Email</h2>
	<p>Post via email is still enabled if you know what to look for, but the configuration settings are gone and are not likely to return. I do not think that blogging via email is a necessary feature for 95% of bloggers.</p>
	<h2 id="notes">User Registration</h2>
	<p>You may allow or disallow user registration in your <a href="wp-admin/options-general.php">General options</a>. If &quot;new users can blog&quot; is disabled, you must first raise the level of a newly registered user to allow
	  them to post. Click the plus sign next to their name on the <a href="wp-admin/users.php">Users</a> page.</p>
	<h2>User Levels</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>0 - New User</li>
		<li>1 - User can post, edit, and delete their own posts.</li>
		<li>5+ - Admin; can post, edit, delete other people's posts, and change the options.</li>
		<li>Any user whose level is higher than 1, can edit and delete the posts and change the level of lower users. Example: a level 2 user is not an admin, but can edit the posts of level 1 users, and up the level of a new user from 0 to 1.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Typcially, you want to have a team of level 1 users except for you.</p>
	<h2>Final notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If you have any suggestions, ideas, comments, or if you (gasp!) found a bug, join us in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">Support Forums</a></li>
		<li>SteamPress now has a robust plugin API that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this see the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API">plugin documentation in the Codex</a>. In most all cases you shouldn't modify any of the core code.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Share the Love</h2>
	<p>SteamPress has no multi-million dollar marketing campaign or celebrity sponsors,
	  but we do have something even better&#8212;you. If you enjoy SteamPress, please consider telling a friend, setting it up
	  for someone less knowledgable than yourself, or writing the author of a media
	  article that overlooks us.</p>
