Guidelines to contribute:

curly brackets go on their own line.
indentation is done with tabs only.
indentation following a curly bracket is done with one tab.
even one liners need brackets.
always use brackets, don't use if: endif;

Hence:

if ($foo)
{
	print $bar;
}

If you are adding code make sure it doesn't break anything. Even to SVN. Test, test, test, and test again. There is no reason SVN code should break. It might be raw, it might be ugly, but don't break working stuff.
